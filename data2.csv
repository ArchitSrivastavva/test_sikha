1.	Legal and Contractual Concerns: Discussion on the legal and contractual concerns regarding the OSP agreement, German law considerations, and the need for back-to-back coverage.
2.	EU Data Processing Requirement: Concerns raised about Deutsche Bahn's requirement for 100% EU data processing and Salesforce's inability to meet this requirement due to global support operations > The requirement for 100% EU data processing cannot be met by Salesforce. Not even under the completely new Hyperforce conditions, there remains a small restante where the follow the sun principle is still necessary.
3.	Back-to-Back Liability and Tender Compliance: Discussion on the challenges of agreeing to back-to-back liability terms and compliance with the tender's extensive requirements > Salesforce cannot agree to back-to-back liability terms or fully comply with the tender's requirements.
4.	Product Commitment for 12 years: Salesforce is known as the most innovative or one of the most innovative companies in the world. So, I mean, and itâ€™s not possible to give this commitment while AI is changing the whole Service Infrastructure. Commitment on 12 Years is therefore total unrealistic.
5.	Resale Agreement Concerns: Exploration of the resale agreement as an alternative to the OSP model and the legal challenges under German law > The resale agreement model does not work under German law for this tender.
6.	Decision on RFP Participation:  Discussion on the feasibility of participating in the RFP based on the technical, legal, and contractual challenges identified.    > Indication that proceeding with the RFP response may not be feasible.",EN,1,424
